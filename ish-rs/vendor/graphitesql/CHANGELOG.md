### Other

- **`timediff(A, B)`** scalar function — the calendar delta from B to A as
  `(+|-)YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS`, a faithful port of SQLite's `date.c`
  algorithm (byte-identical across 2000+ randomized pairs incl. leap days,
  month boundaries, and sub-second; NULL/invalid → NULL).
- **`CREATE TEMP VIEW` / `CREATE TEMP TRIGGER`** now live in the `temp` catalog
  (`sqlite_temp_master`), not `main`'s `sqlite_master`, matching sqlite — a temp
  view resolves via the temp catalog (shadowing main) and a temp trigger fires on
  writes to its table (including a `main` table). `CREATE TEMP INDEX` already did.
- **`json_error_position(X)`** scalar function — the 1-based byte position of the
  first JSON syntax error (0 if valid, NULL for NULL). Matches sqlite3 on
  well-formed JSON and the common structural-error shapes; JSON5 inputs sqlite
  accepts (unquoted keys, trailing commas) diverge, since graphite's JSON parser
  is strict RFC-8259.
- **Planner (B2b): `SELECT count(*)` via a covering index.** A bare `count(*)`
  over a single rowid table with exactly one full (non-partial) secondary index
  now counts the index's entries instead of scanning the table, and `EXPLAIN
  QUERY PLAN` reports `SCAN t USING COVERING INDEX <name>` (matching sqlite).
  Conservative: any WHERE/GROUP BY/HAVING/DISTINCT/join, a WITHOUT ROWID table,
  or zero/multiple candidate indexes falls back to the plain table scan.

- **`json_pretty(X [, indent])`** -- reformats JSON with indentation (default 4
  spaces; empty arrays/objects and scalars stay compact), byte-compatible with
  sqlite3.
- **`CURRENT_DATE` / `CURRENT_TIME` / `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`** keywords now evaluate
  (UTC), equivalent to `date`/`time`/`datetime('now')` -- in expressions and as
  column `DEFAULT`s. A quoted `"current_date"` stays an identifier.
- **Bare `pragma_<name>` table-valued functions** (no parentheses) now work as
  a FROM source (e.g. `SELECT name FROM pragma_database_list`), the zero-argument
  form, matching sqlite; a real table/view/CTE of the same name still shadows it.
- **`sqlite_version()`** scalar function -- returns the SQLite release graphitesql
  tracks and writes into new file headers (`3.53.2`).
- **`UPDATE OR IGNORE/REPLACE/ABORT/ROLLBACK/FAIL`** conflict clauses are now
  parsed and honored: `OR IGNORE` skips a row whose update would violate a
  UNIQUE/NOT NULL/CHECK constraint, `OR REPLACE` deletes the conflicting rows
  first, and `OR ABORT`/`ROLLBACK`/`FAIL` (and the default) fail the statement --
  matching sqlite.
- **`if(...)`** is now accepted as SQLite's alias for `iif(...)`, and both
  accept the 2-argument form (`if(cond, x)` -> `x` or NULL).
- Fix: **`NATURAL JOIN` and `JOIN … USING (…)`** now work. `NATURAL` was parsed
  as a table alias (`FROM t AS natural JOIN …`), silently turning a natural join
  into a cross join with wrong results; both forms now join on equality of the
  common / named columns and coalesce each into a single output column
  (`COALESCE(left, right)` for outer joins), keeping it in its left position and
  referenceable unqualified — matching sqlite. A `NATURAL` join with no common
  column degrades to a cross join, and a `USING` column absent from either side
  is an error, both as in sqlite.
- **Planner (B0): index-driven `ORDER BY`.** A single-table full scan whose sole
  `ORDER BY` term is satisfied by a scan order now skips the sort: the rowid /
  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY case uses the table b-tree (`SCAN t`), and a column that is
  the leading column of a full (non-partial) index whose collation matches scans
  that index in key order (`SCAN t USING INDEX …`). `DESC` reverses (index
  NULLs-first → NULLs-last, matching `ORDER BY … DESC`). `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`,
  the scan, and the skipped sort share one planner decision so they stay in
  lockstep; verified against sqlite incl. NULLs, ties, `DESC`, `LIMIT`, and a
  NOCASE index. Conservative: any `WHERE`/grouping/aggregate/window/`DISTINCT`,
  `COLLATE`, extra ORDER BY terms, partial/expression index, or a shadowing
  column falls back to the in-memory sort.
- **Planner (B2): covering-index reads.** When the index satisfying an ordered
  scan also holds every column the query references (an indexed column or the
  rowid), rows are built directly from the index records and the table b-tree is
  not touched; `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` reports `USING COVERING INDEX` (else plain
  `USING INDEX`), matching sqlite. Coverage detection is conservative — a
  wildcard over a non-covered column, an expression/function/subquery result
  column, or any generated column on the table disables it.
- **`PRAGMA collation_list`** lists the three built-in collating sequences (BINARY/NOCASE/RTRIM).
- **`PRAGMA table_list [(name)]`**: one row per table/view across main + temp +
  attached databases — `(schema, name, type, ncol, wr, strict)` — plus each
  database's synthetic schema table (`temp` always listed, matching sqlite).
  View `ncol` is the output-column count; `wr`/`strict` flag WITHOUT ROWID /
  STRICT tables. Row set verified equal to the sqlite3 CLI.
- Track C6a: **`auto_vacuum` awareness.** `PRAGMA auto_vacuum` now reports the
  database's mode (0 = NONE, 1 = FULL, 2 = INCREMENTAL). graphite reads
  `auto_vacuum` databases created by sqlite3 (pointer-map pages are skipped
  naturally; `integrity_check` ok), but — because it does not yet maintain
  ptrmap pages — refuses to *write* one (`Unsupported`) rather than corrupt its
  pointer map, and rejects `PRAGMA auto_vacuum=FULL|INCREMENTAL`. Ordinary
  (`auto_vacuum=NONE`) databases are unaffected.
- Track C: **`ATTACH`/`DETACH`, `TEMP`, and cross-database queries** (C1–C5).
  `ATTACH ':memory:'/'file.db' AS x` and `DETACH x` manage an attached-database
  registry (`PRAGMA database_list`). Schema-qualified names (`aux.t`) work for
  reads and writes (`CREATE`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`DROP … aux.t`,
  `aux.sqlite_master`), databases isolated, cross-engine verified. `CREATE TEMP
  TABLE` lives in a private in-memory `temp` database (seq 1) that shadows main
  for unqualified names and never persists to a file; `sqlite_temp_master` reads
  it. File attachments are sqlite3-readable/writable both directions.
  **Cross-database joins** now work (`SELECT … FROM main.u JOIN aux.o ON …`),
  each source materialized through its own backend, with 3-part column names
  (`aux.tbl.col`) parsed; `WITHOUT ROWID` tables read cross-db too. Qualified
  `ALTER TABLE aux.t …` (ADD / RENAME COLUMN / RENAME TABLE),
  `CREATE INDEX aux.idx ON t(…)`, `CREATE TRIGGER aux.tr … ON t …`, and
  `CREATE VIEW aux.v AS …` target the attached database (stored bare-named,
  cross-engine verified; trigger bodies' `NEW.col` left intact). Cross-database
  **view reads** resolve the view body's unqualified tables (joins, subqueries,
  nested views) in the view's own database. **Cross-database transactions**:
  `BEGIN … COMMIT/ROLLBACK` spanning main + temp + attached databases
  commits/rolls back them together (data and DDL); file attachments persist on
  commit and leave no trace on rollback. The multi-schema track is complete.
- **Transaction & DDL state checks**: nested `BEGIN`, and `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`
  with no active transaction, are now rejected; `DROP` of a missing object
  reports lowercase "no such <kind>" with a table↔view hint; `ALTER … RENAME
  COLUMN` onto an existing name and `RENAME TABLE` onto an existing table/index
  are rejected with SQLite's messages.
- **CREATE TABLE validations** matching SQLite: duplicate column name, more than
  one PRIMARY KEY, a PRIMARY KEY/UNIQUE list naming a missing column,
  AUTOINCREMENT only on an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (and not on WITHOUT ROWID), and a
  table with no non-generated column.
- Fix: the **`%` operator** truncates both operands to integers (`10.5 % 3` → 1.0,
  divisor truncating to 0 → NULL), like SQLite; the `mod()` function stays floating.
- **`string_agg`** added as the standard-SQL alias for `group_concat`.
- **`json_group_array` / `json_group_object` aggregates** — build a JSON array
  or object from a group (NULL-inclusive, `ORDER BY` inside the aggregate, JSON
  subtype propagation for `json(...)` arguments), like SQLite.
- Fix: **collation is now honored** in `IN (list)`, `IN (SELECT …)`, `BETWEEN`,
  `CASE x WHEN y`, `min()`/`max()`, and compound set ops (UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT
  dedup + their ORDER BY) — these used plain BINARY before, so NOCASE columns
  diverged from SQLite. (Literal-left `IN`/comparison falling back to the
  subquery/right column's collation, and window-frame min/max, remain edges.)
- **`printf`/`format` `,` thousands-grouping flag and `l`/`ll` length
  modifiers** (`printf('%,d', 1234567)` → `1,234,567`; `%ld`/`%lld` accepted).
- Fix: **`UPDATE OF <columns>` triggers** fire only when one of the named
  columns is in the UPDATE's SET list (previously fired on any update).
- Fix: **`NEW.rowid` / `OLD.rowid`** (and qualified rowid in correlated
  subqueries) now resolve inside trigger bodies.
- **SELECT-list aliases in WHERE/GROUP BY/HAVING** are now resolved (a real
  column of the same name still takes precedence), matching SQLite — e.g.
  `SELECT a+b AS s FROM t WHERE s>3` and `… GROUP BY m`/`HAVING c>1`.
- Fix: **CTE explicit column list** must match the body column count
  (`table t has N values for M columns`), like SQLite.
- Fix: a **multi-row `VALUES` on the right of a compound operator** (e.g.
  `… UNION VALUES(2),(3)`) now contributes all its rows, not just the first.
- Track A: **`UPDATE … SET … FROM <sources>`** (SQLite's UPDATE-FROM extension)
  — the target table is joined to the FROM tables (incl. multi-table and
  derived-table sources); each matched target row is updated using the joined
  row's columns, firing triggers and enforcing constraints as usual.
- Fix: **LIMIT/OFFSET on a recursive CTE** is honored — it bounds the produced
  rows and terminates the recursion (was stripped, causing "did not terminate").
- Fix: **HAVING without GROUP BY** parses and runs (whole result = one group);
  a HAVING on a non-aggregate query is rejected like SQLite.
- Fix: **`PRAGMA table_info.dflt_value`** is the default expression's SQL text
  (string defaults keep their quotes, `DEFAULT NULL` shows `NULL`).
- Fix: **table-qualified rowid aliases** (`t.rowid` / `t._rowid_` / `t.oid`) now
  resolve (bare forms already did); a real column of that name still wins.
- Fix: **`*` / `table.*` mixed with aggregates** (`SELECT *, count(*) …`) now
  works — wildcards expand to columns following the representative-row rule.
- Track A: **`INSERT … SELECT`** — populate a table from a query (compound
  sources and target column lists included). The query is snapshotted before any
  insert, so `INSERT INTO t SELECT … FROM t` terminates; rows then flow through
  the ordinary insert path (defaults, constraints, triggers, indexes). As part
  of this, a bare `VALUES` row with an implicit column list is now required to
  match the column count, matching SQLite.
- **Schema catalog queryable** as `sqlite_schema` and the historical
  `sqlite_master` (read-only 5-column rowid table at page 1); direct DML against
  it is rejected with "table … may not be modified".
- Fix: **`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` constraint restrictions** — a `UNIQUE` or
  `PRIMARY KEY` column is rejected, and a `NOT NULL` column with a NULL default
  is rejected when the table already has rows, matching SQLite.
- Fix: **subqueries rejected in CHECK constraints and generated columns** at
  `CREATE` time (SQLite forbids them; graphite previously evaluated them).
- Fix: **`sum()`/`abs()` integer overflow is an error** (not a silent real
  promotion), matching SQLite — the `+`/`*` operators still fall back to real.
- Fix: **`-9223372036854775808` parses as `Integer(i64::MIN)`** (the literal
  `2^63` folds under a leading minus) instead of a real; `typeof` and `abs()`
  now agree with SQLite.
- Fix: **text→number ignores `inf`/`infinity`/`nan`** (value 0 / NULL like
  SQLite); numeric overflow such as `1e400` still yields ±Inf.
- Track A: **`STRICT` tables**. `CREATE TABLE … STRICT` (alone or with `WITHOUT
  ROWID`, in either order) restricts column types to `INT`/`INTEGER`/`REAL`/
  `TEXT`/`BLOB`/`ANY` — any other or missing type is rejected at `CREATE` — and
  type-checks every stored value against its column on INSERT/UPDATE/UPSERT
  (`ANY` columns store values with no affinity). The whole type×value matrix,
  the stored `typeof`/`quote`, and the `CREATE`-time rejections all match
  `sqlite3`, which also reads our STRICT files and enforces them identically.
- Fix: **UNIQUE enforcement for standalone indexes**. A `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`
  (plain, partial, expression, or multi-column) was maintained but never
  *enforced* — duplicate keys were silently accepted. `find_conflicts` (and the
  WITHOUT ROWID write paths) now check these indexes, collation- and NULL-aware,
  covering INSERT/UPDATE/UPSERT/`OR IGNORE`/`OR REPLACE`.
- Track B: **hash join**. A two-table join with an equi-join `left.col = right.col`
  in its `ON` now builds a hash index on the joined table and probes it per left
  row (the full `ON` is still re-evaluated on each candidate, so semantics are
  unchanged), turning the O(n·m) nested loop into a probe. Numeric keys collide
  across `INTEGER`/`REAL` (`5` and `5.0`) and across affinity (`5`/`'5'`) via
  multi-keying; non-`BINARY` collations fall back to the nested loop. Verified
  against `sqlite3` (numeric/text/NOCASE/duplicate-key/NULL/outer/self joins).
- Fix: pre-comparison type affinity no longer text-coerces a typeless (BLOB/NONE)
  column against a TEXT column — `none_col = text_col` now matches SQLite (e.g.
  integer `1` vs `'1'` is false). `expr_affinity` distinguishes a literal's
  absence of affinity from a column's BLOB affinity.

- Track B: **`IN`-list index seeks**. A single-table query with `column IN (c1,
  c2, …)` now seeks each constant through an index on that column (or the rowid
  b-tree for an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`), unions the rowids, and fetches the rows,
  instead of scanning. Returns a superset (full `WHERE` re-applied). Verified
  against `sqlite3`.
- Track B: **OR-by-union**. A single-table query whose `WHERE` is a top-level `OR`
  of individually index/rowid-seekable predicates (equality, `IN`, range, or an
  `AND` containing one) now seeks each disjunct, unions the rowids, and fetches the
  rows once, instead of scanning. If any disjunct is not seekable it falls back to
  a scan. Superset semantics keep it correct (full `WHERE` re-applied). Verified
  against `sqlite3`, including ORs spanning two different indexes. `EXPLAIN QUERY
  PLAN` reports these as SQLite's nested `MULTI-INDEX OR` / `INDEX 1` / `SEARCH …`
  structure.
- Track B: `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` now reports the index range and `IN`-list seeks as
  `SEARCH … USING INDEX … (a>? AND a<?)` / `(a=?)` (and rowid `IN` as
  `… INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)`), matching SQLite's format and reflecting what
  the executor actually does.
- Track B: index **range scans**. A single-table query whose `WHERE` constrains an
  indexed column by `<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=`/`BETWEEN` now seeks the index between those
  bounds (`btree::index_range_rowids`, an in-order traversal that stops once the
  upper bound is passed) instead of scanning the whole table, then re-applies the
  full `WHERE`. The lookup returns a superset, so correctness is preserved
  regardless of bound edge cases. A range on the `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` rowid walks
  the table b-tree directly between integer bounds (seeking the lower bound, then
  iterating until the upper). Both verified against `sqlite3`, and reported by
  `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` as `SEARCH … (rowid>? AND rowid<?)` etc.
- Track A: `octet_length(X)` (byte length of a value's encoding — blob bytes, else
  the UTF-8 length of its text form) and the `glob(pattern, text)` function form of
  the `GLOB` operator. Both verified against `sqlite3` in the differential corpus.
- Track D: table-valued functions — `generate_series(start, stop[, step])`,
  `json_each`, and `json_tree` as `FROM` sources (sole source or joined).
  `json_each` yields the direct children, `json_tree` the full depth-first tree,
  each with the `key`/`value`/`type`/`atom`/`id`/`parent`/`fullkey`/`path` columns
  (the `id`/`parent` numbering is graphitesql's own; the rest match SQLite).
  Establishes the TVF mechanism (`TableRef.tvf_args`). Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: `RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN` and `FULL [OUTER] JOIN`. The nested-loop join now
  tracks matched right rows and emits the unmatched ones with NULL left columns
  (and unmatched left rows for `FULL`/`LEFT`). Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: `LIKE … ESCAPE`, the `like(pattern, text[, escape])` function form, and
  the `likely`/`unlikely`/`likelihood` optimizer-hint functions (identity at the
  value level). Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: `CREATE TABLE … AS SELECT …` (CTAS). The new table's columns are the
  query's output labels (untyped), populated with the query's rows via the normal
  insert path. Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: `INDEXED BY name` / `NOT INDEXED` query hints. `NOT INDEXED` forces a
  table scan; `INDEXED BY` restricts the planner to the named index (and errors if
  it does not exist). Results are identical to the unhinted query. Verified.
- Track A: ordered aggregates — `group_concat(x ORDER BY y [DESC])` (and any
  aggregate with an inner `ORDER BY`) sorts the group's rows before folding,
  honoring `DESC`/`NULLS` and collation. Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: `percent_rank()` and `cume_dist()` window functions. Verified against
  `sqlite3`.
- Track A: named windows — `WINDOW w AS (…)` definitions with `OVER w` references
  and `OVER (w ORDER BY …)` extension (a base window supplies `PARTITION BY`; the
  use may add `ORDER BY`/frame). Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track C: in-engine `PRAGMA integrity_check` / `quick_check`. Walks every table
  and index b-tree and verifies each index holds exactly the entries its table
  implies (honoring partial-index predicates), returning `ok` when consistent or
  one row per problem — no longer delegated to `sqlite3`. Agrees with `sqlite3` on
  valid databases (rowid/WITHOUT ROWID, multi-column/unique/partial/expression
  indexes).
- Track C: introspection PRAGMAs — `index_list`, `index_info`,
  `foreign_key_list`, `foreign_key_check`, `freelist_count`, `application_id`,
  `data_version`. Output matches SQLite's column layout and ordering;
  `foreign_key_check` reports `(table, rowid, parent, fkid)` for each dangling
  reference. Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: expression indexes — `CREATE INDEX … (lower(x))`, `(a + b)`, etc. The
  index key is the per-row evaluation of the term expressions; entries are
  maintained on insert/update/delete and rebuild, so `sqlite3 integrity_check`
  (which recomputes the expressions) passes. The planner scans rather than
  seeking an expression index. (Not supported on WITHOUT ROWID tables yet.)
  Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: partial indexes — `CREATE INDEX … WHERE <predicate>`. The index stores
  only rows satisfying the predicate; entries are added/removed as rows cross the
  boundary on insert/update/delete, so `sqlite3 integrity_check` passes. The
  planner conservatively scans rather than seeking a partial index (always
  correct). Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: `VALUES` as a query — standalone (`VALUES (1,2),(3,4)`) and as a table
  source (`SELECT … FROM (VALUES …)`). Desugared to a `UNION ALL` of single-row
  selects with SQLite's `column1`/`column2`/… naming. Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: aggregate `FILTER (WHERE …)`. `count`/`sum`/`avg`/`total`/
  `group_concat`/… accept a `FILTER (WHERE predicate)` that restricts which rows
  of the group they consume, grouped or ungrouped. Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track C: `SAVEPOINT` / `RELEASE` / `ROLLBACK TO` nested transactions. The write
  pager snapshots its staged state on `SAVEPOINT`; `ROLLBACK TO` restores it
  (keeping the savepoint open and repeatable), `RELEASE` discards it keeping the
  changes, and releasing the outermost savepoint of an implicit transaction
  commits. Savepoints nest inside `BEGIN`, revert schema changes, and persist to
  disk on release. Verified against `sqlite3` semantics.
- Track A: row-value expressions — `(a,b) = (c,d)`, lexicographic ordering
  (`<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=`), `(a,b) IN ((…),(…))`, and `(a,b) IN (SELECT …)`, with
  SQLite's three-valued NULL semantics (an undecided element yields NULL; a
  decisive earlier element still resolves). Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: JSON `->`/`->>` operators and mutators. `->` returns the extracted
  node as JSON, `->>` as a SQL value; a bare-label or integer right operand is
  normalized to `$.label`/`$[n]`. Added `json_set`, `json_insert`,
  `json_replace`, `json_remove`, and RFC-7396 `json_patch`; nested
  `json_array`/`json_object` arguments embed as JSON. Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: `ORDER BY … NULLS FIRST/LAST` and `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM`. NULL
  placement in sorts is now controllable (default stays SQLite's: NULLs first
  under `ASC`, last under `DESC`); `IS DISTINCT FROM`/`IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` are
  the null-aware (in)equality operators. Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track C: VFS advisory-locking contract and writer serialization. A new
  `LockState` encodes SQLite's `SHARED`/`RESERVED`/`PENDING`/`EXCLUSIVE`
  compatibility rules; `MemoryVfs` and `StdVfs` now share one lock state per path
  across all open handles (process-local). The write pager takes the write-intent
  lock when staging a transaction and upgrades to exclusive while flushing, so a
  second connection writing the same database is rejected with `Error::Busy`
  while another holds an open write transaction — and the lock is released on
  commit, rollback, and autocommit. (Reads buffer per-connection so they stay
  isolated from uncommitted writes; cross-process OS locks remain a host-VFS
  concern.)
- Track B: VDBE bytecode IR spike. A new `exec::vdbe` module defines a
  register-machine instruction set (`Op`), a `Program`, a compiler for constant
  `SELECT` projections, and an interpreter — built *alongside* the tree-walking
  executor (not replacing it) so the IR can grow incrementally toward cursors and
  filters. The compiled+interpreted output matches both the tree-walker and
  `sqlite3` for arithmetic, concatenation, comparison, three-valued `AND`/`OR`/
  `NOT`, `IS [NOT] NULL`, `CASE` (via `Goto`/`IfFalse` control flow on a
  program-counter interpreter), and `CAST` projections; unsupported queries
  cleanly report `Unsupported` for fallback. The IR also scans a single plain
  table with an optional `WHERE` filter (`Rewind`/`Column`/`Next` cursor ops with
  an `IfFalse` row skip), wired into the engine via the new
  `Connection::query_vdbe`, matching the tree-walker and `sqlite3` for
  `SELECT <exprs> FROM <table> [WHERE …] [ORDER BY …] [LIMIT n [OFFSET m]]` (a
  `DecrJumpZero` counter caps the row count; an `IfPosDecr` counter skips the
  leading `OFFSET` rows). `ORDER BY` compiles to a sorter: the scan stages each
  projected row plus its key columns (`SorterInsert`), then after the scan the
  rows are sorted (`SorterSort`, honoring `DESC`/`NULLS FIRST`/`LAST`) and a
  second cursor loop (`SorterRewind`/`SorterRow`/`SorterNext`) emits them with
  `OFFSET`/`LIMIT` applied to the sorted output. Output-column ordinals
  (`ORDER BY 2`) and aliases (`ORDER BY d`) resolve to their projection.
  `SELECT DISTINCT` compiles to a `DistinctCheck` gate (NULLs compare equal) that
  drops duplicate output rows before `OFFSET`/`LIMIT`, composing with `ORDER BY`
  (dedup, then sort). Whole-table aggregates (`count`/`sum`/`total`/`avg`/`min`/
  `max`/`group_concat`, no `GROUP BY`) compile to `AggStep`/`AggFinal`: the scan
  folds each slot (counting rows for `count(*)`, collecting non-NULL arguments
  otherwise) and a single `ResultRow` emits the finalized values, reproducing the
  tree-walker's exact semantics (integer-`sum` overflow promotes to real, empty
  group yields 0/NULL per function). `GROUP BY <columns>` over a single table
  compiles to `GroupStep`/`GroupEmit`: the scan folds per-group accumulators
  (groups kept in first-seen order, NULLs grouping together, matching the
  tree-walker) and one row per group is emitted, where each output column is
  either a grouping-key value or a finalized aggregate. `HAVING`/`ORDER BY`/
  non-grouped output expressions fall back to the tree-walker.
- Track B: `ANALYZE` and cost-based index selection. `ANALYZE [name]` gathers
  index selectivity into a `sqlite_stat1(tbl,idx,stat)` table, byte-compatible
  with SQLite's `nRow avgEq1 avgEq2 …` format (`avgEqK = (nRow + dK/2)/dK`);
  no-index tables get a `(tbl, NULL, nRow)` row, empty indexes are skipped, and
  re-analyzing replaces a table's rows. The planner (both execution and
  `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`) now prefers the most selective usable index per those
  statistics, falling back to the longest-prefix heuristic when unanalyzed.
  Verified against `sqlite3` incl. `integrity_check`.
- Track A: SQLite JSON functions — `json`, `json_valid`, `json_quote`,
  `json_type`, `json_array_length`, `json_extract`, `json_array`, `json_object`.
  Includes a pure-`core` RFC-8259 parser/serializer and `$`/`.key`/`[n]` path
  navigation; JSON scalars map back to SQL values (`true`/`false`→1/0,
  `null`→NULL), objects/arrays return minified JSON text, and nested
  `json_array`/`json_object` calls embed as JSON (subtype propagation by call
  origin). Verified against `sqlite3`. (Mutators `json_set`/`json_remove`/…, the
  `->`/`->>` operators, and `json_each`/`json_tree` are not yet implemented.)
- Track A: SQLite math functions — `pi`, `sqrt`, `exp`, `ln`, `log`/`log10`/
  `log2`, `pow`/`power`, `mod`, `ceil`/`ceiling`, `floor`, `trunc`, `sin`/`cos`/
  `tan`, `asin`/`acos`/`atan`/`atan2`, `sinh`/`cosh`/`tanh`,
  `asinh`/`acosh`/`atanh`, `degrees`, `radians`. Implemented in pure `core`
  arithmetic (no libm dependency): `sqrt` is correctly rounded; the transcendentals
  are accurate to ~1 ULP. NULL/domain errors return NULL. Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: UPSERT and `RETURNING`. `INSERT … ON CONFLICT [(target)] DO NOTHING`
  skips the conflicting row; `DO UPDATE SET … [WHERE …]` updates the existing
  row, exposing the would-be-inserted values via the `excluded` pseudo-table and
  honoring a vetoing `WHERE`. `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE … RETURNING <cols|*>`
  projects the affected rows; drained via the new `Connection::execute_returning`.
  Verified against `sqlite3`. (WITHOUT ROWID upsert/returning not yet supported.)
- Track A: collating sequences — `BINARY`/`NOCASE`/`RTRIM` honored in comparisons,
  `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`, `count(DISTINCT …)`, `UNIQUE` enforcement, and
  index b-tree ordering/seek. Resolution follows SQLite: explicit `COLLATE` (left
  precedence) > column collation (left precedence) > `BINARY`. NOCASE/RTRIM indexes
  order their keys by the collation so `sqlite3 integrity_check` passes, and
  index-driven equality lookups find case-variant rows. Verified against `sqlite3`.
- Track A: generated columns — `… AS (expr) [STORED|VIRTUAL]`. VIRTUAL columns
  are computed on read and not stored; STORED ones are materialized on write;
  writes to a generated column are rejected; indexes over generated columns work;
  `table_info` hides them. Verified against `sqlite3` incl. `integrity_check`.
- Phase 9: b-tree page merging on delete — a delete that empties table leaf pages
  now compacts the b-tree in place (root preserved), returning the slack to the
  freelist for reuse so the file no longer grows unboundedly across delete/insert
  cycles; verified valid across heavy/scattered/full deletes by `sqlite3`
  `integrity_check`. This clears the last named Phase 9 deliverable.
