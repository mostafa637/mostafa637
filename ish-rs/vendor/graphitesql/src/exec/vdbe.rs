//! A minimal register-machine (VDBE) IR and interpreter.
//!
//! This is the first concrete step of the Track B "executor → VDBE" migration: a
//! self-contained bytecode IR plus a compiler for constant `SELECT` projections
//! and an interpreter that runs them. It does **not** replace the tree-walking
//! executor — it runs alongside it so the IR can be grown incrementally (table
//! cursors, filters, joins) while the existing engine keeps serving queries.
//!
//! The design mirrors SQLite's VDBE shape (`vdbe.c`): a flat instruction array
//! over a register file driven by a program counter, where each op reads/writes
//! registers by index, `Goto`/`IfFalse` branch, and a `ResultRow` op emits a span
//! of registers as an output row. graphitesql's ops are a small, safe-Rust subset
//! covering constant `SELECT` projections (literals, arithmetic, concat,
//! comparison, three-valued boolean logic, `IS NULL`, `CASE`, `CAST`).
