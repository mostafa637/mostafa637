//! The OS abstraction layer: graphitesql's only I/O boundary.
//!
//! Everything the engine does to durable storage goes through the [`Vfs`] and
//! [`File`] traits, exactly as SQLite routes all I/O through its `sqlite3_vfs`.
//! This is what lets the same engine run against in-memory storage, real files,
//! or a host-provided WebAssembly backend without changing a line above this
//! layer.
//!
//! Two implementations ship in the crate:
//!
//! * [`memory::MemoryVfs`] — `Vec<u8>`-backed, always available (incl. `no_std`
//!   and wasm). Backs `:memory:` and is the default for tests.
//! * [`std_file::StdVfs`] — real files via `std::fs` (feature `std`).
//!
//! Positioned reads/writes (`*_at`) are used throughout rather than a stateful
//! cursor, mirroring `pread`/`pwrite`; this keeps the pager's intent explicit
//! and avoids a shared seek offset.
