//! The write-side pager: buffered page mutations with atomic, journaled commit.
//!
//! All mutations during a transaction are buffered in an in-memory *overlay*
//! (page number → full page image). Nothing touches the database file until
//! [`commit`](WritePager::commit):
//!
//! * **ROLLBACK** is therefore trivial and always correct — drop the overlay.
//! * **COMMIT** is made crash-safe with a rollback journal: the original
//!   contents of every page about to be overwritten are written to a journal
//!   file and synced *before* the database file is modified; the journal is
//!   cleared only after the database is synced. A crash mid-commit leaves a
//!   journal that the next [`open`](WritePager::open) replays via recovery.
//!
//! Reads consult the overlay first, so within a transaction the pager is
//! read-your-writes consistent. It implements [`PageSource`], so the existing
//! b-tree cursors and schema reader work over it unchanged.
